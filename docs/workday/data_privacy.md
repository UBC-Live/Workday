# Data Privacy

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to summarize the key privacy and security expectations relevant to this project and to outline the requirements for responsibly accessing and handling any Workday data.

## Personal Information (PI)
Personal information includes any recorded information about an identifiable individual, except for basic business contact details. Examples include: 
- names, employee IDs, contact information, employment details, or any data that could identify someone when combined with other information.

## How Privacy Applies to This Project
This project may involve accessing or handling Workday data that contains PI. At UBC, “privacy” refers to a set of rules that govern how personal information is collected, used, disclosed, protected, stored, and retained. These rules come from the **Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA)**, which applies to all UBC employees, volunteers, and service providers.

FIPPA requires UBC to ensure that personal information is handled in a lawful, secure, and appropriate manner. This includes using data only for authorized purposes, limiting disclosure on a strict need-to-know basis, storing data securely within approved UBC systems, retaining it only as long as necessary, and protecting it from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
